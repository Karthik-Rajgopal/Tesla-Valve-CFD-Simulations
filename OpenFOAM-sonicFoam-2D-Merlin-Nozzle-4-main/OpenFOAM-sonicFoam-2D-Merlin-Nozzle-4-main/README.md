# OpenFOAM-rhoCentralFoam-2D-CD-Nozzle-4

This Repository contains everything needed to complete a basic CFD analysis of a Rocket Nozzle cross section. The analysis will be performed using the basic specifications from a SpaceX Merlin 1D engine

The repository contains the following basic sections:
  - Pre-processing:
    - Matlab Code to generate it (a lightly modified version of: https://github.com/Vinayak-D/MOC-MATLAB)
    - Surface Generated in SolidWorks
    - Fluent Mesh file
  - OpenFoam Simulation:
    - Files needed to execute the simulation using the rhoCentralFoam solver in OpenFoam
    - list of intructions
  - Post-processing
    - contour plots, volume animations, force plot, etc...

Please let me know if you have any questions
